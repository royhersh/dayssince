# Days Since

> Application link - https://dayssince.royhersh.me

This is an educational side project I made in order to study methodologies I hardly use in my day job.  
The goal for this project is to deepen my knowledge in full stack web application building especially in Node.js, MongoDB, ,React/Redux, Testing and Docker.

## Running dev environment using Docker

If you have docker installed on your machine, simply type:

```
npm run dev:docker
```

## Running dev environment locally

1. Install MongoDB on your local machine
2. Make sure you're on node at least 10.13
3. `npm run init`
4. `npm run dev`

#### Tasks:

- Write documentation for the API

#### Open Issues

- Count the days since 7am and not since last 24 hrs.
- Fix rendering order issues.
- Items are not updated on the fly, require refresh (setTimout).

#### Futures Backlog:

- Suggest user to sign-up after x actions.
- Save history when an item is being reset to 0.
- Set threshold alerts, e.g alert me If I didn't do sport for 3 days.
- Share items with other users.
- re arrange items order.
- days until feature.
